# E-commerce
How to Setup a Laravel Project:
1. Clone GitHub repo for this project locally
https://github.com/FadyBengoufa/E-commerce.git
or download the zip folder
2. cd into this e-commerce project after you cloned it
3. Install Composer Dependencies this will add a composer.json file
composer install
4. Install NPM Dependencies this will add a packages.json file
npm install or yarn
5-Create a copy of your .env file
cp .env.example .env
6. Generate an app encryption key and add it to the .env file in the APP_KEY field
php artisan key:generate
7. Create an empty database for our application
in this project name it "e-com"
8. In the .env file, add database information to allow Laravel to connect to the database
DB_HOST=
DB_PORT=
DB_DATABASE=e-com or you could change the name of the database
DB_USERNAME=yourusername
DB_PASSWORD=yourpassword
9. Migrate the database
php artisan migrate
10.Seed the database
php artisan db:seed

To access the admin dashboard you need to go to admin/login then add in the database in the admins table using the terminal:
php artisan tinker 
then create and admin instance : $admin = new App\Admin();
add the name and email and the hashed password :
$admin-name = "adminname"
$admin-email = "adminname@gmail.com"
$admin->password = Hash::make(123456789); //need to be at least 8 characters
$admin->save();
Then you can log in as admin !
and Hopefully that's all you need to start your project.
